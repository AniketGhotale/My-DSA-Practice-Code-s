# My DSA Practice Codes

This repository contains all the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems I practice daily during my DSA practice journey. I upload one folder every 2 days, and so far I have completed 42 folders till now.
I solve at least 1–2 problems every day to improve my coding logic, problem-solving skills, and understanding of core concepts.
The main purpose of maintaining this repo is to track my progress, improve consistency, and build strong problem-solving skills.
